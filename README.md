Garbage Classification for Efficient Waste Management

This project aims to classify waste into 10 categories (clothes, trash, paper, plastic, metal, cardboard, biological, battery, glass, shoes) using two deep learning models: VGG16 (a pre-trained CNN) and a standard CNN. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, has been reduced in size for efficient training
